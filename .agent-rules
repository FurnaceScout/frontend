# Agent Rules for FurnaceScout Development

## Testing
- Always test upon each phase completion
- Run `bun run build` to verify no build errors
- Test critical user flows manually (homepage, block viewing, transaction viewing)
- Document any test results or issues discovered

## Git Workflow
- Always pause between each completed task for git commit/push
- Use descriptive commit messages following format: "feat: [description]" or "fix: [description]"
- Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding to next task after commit

## Documentation
- Always update the checklist (FEATURE_ROADMAP.md) when an item is completed
- Mark completed items with [x] and add completion notes if relevant
- Do not update the README until each phase is completed to cut down on wasted token usage
- Update CHANGELOG.md only at phase completion, not after individual tasks

## Development Workflow
1. Complete a task/feature
2. Test the implementation
3. Update FEATURE_ROADMAP.md checklist
4. Pause for user to commit/push
5. Wait for user confirmation to proceed
6. Move to next task

## Phase Completion
When a full phase is completed:
1. Run comprehensive tests
2. Update README.md with new features/capabilities
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with phase summary
4. Create detailed commit message summarizing phase work
5. Pause for final review and commit/push

## Communication
- Be explicit about what was completed
- Clearly state when pausing for git operations
- Ask for confirmation before moving to next task or phase

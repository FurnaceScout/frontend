# Agent Rules for FurnaceScout Development

## Optimization Checklist
- After completing ANY optimization task from OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md, you MUST immediately mark it as complete with [x]
- Never proceed to the next optimization task without first updating the checklist
- Add brief completion notes next to checked items if relevant (e.g., `[x] Task name - completed, 50% improvement`)
- The checklist is the source of truth for optimization progress

## Testing
- Always test upon each phase completion
- Run `bun run build` to verify no build errors
- Test critical user flows manually (homepage, block viewing, transaction viewing)
- Document any test results or issues discovered

## Git Workflow
- **MANDATORY**: After completing each task, you MUST pause and wait for the user to commit/push
- Do NOT proceed to the next task until the user confirms the commit is complete
- Use descriptive commit messages following format: "feat: [description]" or "fix: [description]"
- Explicitly state: "Ready for commit. Please commit and push, then confirm to proceed."
- Never batch multiple tasks into a single commit without explicit user approval

## Documentation
- Always update the checklist (FEATURE_ROADMAP.md) when an item is completed
- Mark completed items with [x] and add completion notes if relevant
- Do not update the README until each phase is completed to cut down on wasted token usage
- Update CHANGELOG.md only at phase completion, not after individual tasks

## Development Workflow
1. Complete a task/feature
2. Test the implementation (`bun run build` at minimum)
3. Update relevant checklist:
   - FEATURE_ROADMAP.md for features
   - OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md for optimizations
4. **STOP** - Explicitly tell user: "Task complete. Ready for commit."
5. **WAIT** - Do not proceed until user confirms commit is done
6. Only after user confirmation, move to next task

## Optimization Workflow (Specific)
1. Pick ONE task from OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md
2. Implement the optimization
3. Test with `bun run build`
4. Mark the task as [x] complete in OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md
5. **STOP** and say: "Optimization complete. Please commit and push, then confirm to proceed."
6. **WAIT** for user confirmation
7. Repeat for next task

## Phase Completion
When a full phase is completed:
1. Run comprehensive tests
2. Update README.md with new features/capabilities
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with phase summary
4. Create detailed commit message summarizing phase work
5. Pause for final review and commit/push

## Communication
- Be explicit about what was completed
- Clearly state when pausing for git operations
- Ask for confirmation before moving to next task or phase

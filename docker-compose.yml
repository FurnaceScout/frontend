# To use this docker-compose setup:
#
# 1. If Anvil is running on your host machine (recommended):
#    docker-compose up -d
#
# 2. If you want Anvil in Docker (uncomment anvil service above):
#    Update NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL to: http://anvil:8545
#    docker-compose up -d
#
# 3. To mount a different Foundry project:
#    docker-compose run -v /path/to/project:/foundry-project:ro ironscout
#
# 4. Access IronScout at: http://localhost:3000
